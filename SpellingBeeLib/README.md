# SpellingBeeLib

Subpackage for SpellingBee. This powers the SpellingBee command line tool, but is packaged in a way that allows it to be unit-testable.

Right now if you're pulling this down and trying to run it on your own computer, you're gonna need to change the hardcoded path of the word list in WordList, or it won't work.
